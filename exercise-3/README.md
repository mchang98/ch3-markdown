# Exercise-3

As described in the [git-basics chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

##Local Git Process
###git status
The `git status` command is used to check on the current status of your code.

To use this command, type in:
`git status`

After the command prompt ($) and this will show you a list of things.
-You're in the repository
-You're on the `master` branch
-You're at the initial commit
-The current changes or status of your commits
